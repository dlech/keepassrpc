keepassrpc (1.8.0~xenial1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Works with KeePass 2.39
  * Complete support for KeePass placeholders in any form field
  * Enhanced entry URL matching control
  * Improved entry matching accuracy and speed
  * Extra protection against targeted social engineering attacks
  * KeeFox branding replaced with Kee
  * You can now remove the “Kee” group from your database if you’re not using it
    (and move the still-useful “Kee Generated passwords” group to whichever part
    of your database that you want)
  * New JSONRPC API endpoints for retrieving even entries that have no URL:
    GetAllEntries / GetAllChildEntries
  * Replaced mentions of the “start group” with “home group”
  * Prevent a crash when Page number on form field editor is invalid (#20)
  * Fixed a bug where the username displayed in a Kee search result may be
    different to the one that gets filled in when that entry is auto-filled
    (only in the relatively rare case when there are multiple usernames
    configured on the single entry and one has no Kee configuration)
  * Various other UI improvements: Better sizes for some dialogs, better layout
    for others, clearer instructions and less jargon in others
  * Various code quality improvements: Disposing more objects (thanks to
    @manuc66); lots of new automated tests; removed all the obsolete KeePass API
    calls that we can
