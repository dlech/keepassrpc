[Kee](https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon) is a Firefox and Chrome add-on for linking browsers to KeePass, using the KeePassRPC KeePass plugin contained within this repository.

Community support forum: https://forum.kee.pm

Download KeePassRPC from the [releases page](https://github.com/kee-org/keepassrpc/releases).

KeePass will notify you when updates are available but it does not support automatic updates so you will need to perform the update manually. You can find [instructions on the forum](https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22).

KeePassRPC supports multiple clients, although the Kee web browser add-on is the most widely used. Other known uses include Thunderbird integration and integration with old web browsers such as Firefox before version 57 was released in 2017.

Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests for any changes or improvements you would like to see incorporated to the official KeePassRPC plugin. However, in most cases, it would be best if you discuss your ideas on the Kee [community forum](https://forum.kee.pm) first since the need to support multiple clients with backwards compatible changes can require some careful planning and the most obvious implementation approach is not always the best one.

If your change relates to Thunderbird or older web browsers (those that KeeFox version 1.7 supports but Kee 2.x does not) you can [find appropriate categories](https://forum.kee.pm/categories) in which to start the discussion.
